            <h1>Blink Project</h1>

            <p>In 2014 Immedia Semiconductor successfully ran a Kickstarter campaign for their proprietary low-powered smart security cameras which raised over $1 million. I was contracted as a product design consultant to assist with the design and prototyping of their alpha units for Kickstarter fulfillment. I continued to support future revisions to their productions models.</p>

            <p>Throughout the project I was responsibe for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Holding regular design meetings with various teams to review technical design and user needs</li>
                <li>Designing and refining Sync module components for form and mechanical assembly</li>
                <li>3D printing numerous prototypes for an iterative design process</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In late 2017 the popularity and commercialization of their cameras led to a $90 million acquisition of the company by Amazon.</p>

            <p>About the Company:<br>Immedia Semiconductor  is a leading provider of video and image processing chips for connected camera  applications. Immedia's breakthrough low power solutions with 3D  noise processing and noDRAM™ technologies enable consumer cameras with unprecedented image quality, battery life, price points and form factors. Immedia  is also the company behind Blink, the ultra-affordable smart HD home monitoring  and alert system.</p>

            <p>During a series of observations at Boston Medical Center teams were tasked with identifying a procedure or device that caused inefficiencies or prone to failure during surgeries. Our team decided to focus on improving the efficiency of the frenotomy procedure for neonates that are tongue-tied. The current standard uses a tongue elevator, hemostat, and surgical scissors to incise the frenulum, which requires an experienced practitioner to perform due to the sensitive anatomy of a neonate. Our goal was to create a device that combines the traditional tools for this procedure, is low risk to the infants, and requires minimal training for the operator.</p>

            <p>CSA Medical specializes in cryoablation of internal tissue with liquid nitrogen (LN2). I was solely tasked with the ambitious project of creating a number of test fixtures that contained a 3-dimensional array of 400 temperature measurement points embedded in a tissue-mimicking material. The fixture was then used to find the amount of tissue treated during procedures by controlling for a variety of parameters. This device was used to shape many of company’s product design decisions. The work performed on this project led to an authorship on a pending patent.</p>

            <p>Partnered with two friends, I was charged with designing and prototyping a bike mountable phone case with a built-in light reflector to amplify a phone’s flash LED. The goal of this project was to create a phone case that could replace standard bike lights. </p>
            <p>Throughout the design process I was responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determining optimal reflector shape</li>
                <li>Designing cases for multiple phone models</li>
                <li>Creating a design focused on low-cost injection modling tooling</li>
                <li>3D printing prototypes to test for fit and durability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Several design iterations were completed until we had a design that performed well in field tests. Higher quality 3D prints were made and I obtained several quotes from machine shops for the costs of tooling and injection molding runs. A Kickstarter campaign was launched to try to raise enough funds for manufacturing. Although the design was well-received it did not make the funding goal in time, which we determined was due to the product being advertised as a flashlight rather than a phone mount. Despite this, this was a good experience for project management and marketing, and it served to strengthen my product design skills.</p>
