                        <p>In 2014 Immedia Semiconductor successfully ran a Kickstarter campaign for their proprietary low-powered smart security cameras which raised over $1 million. I was contracted as a product design consultant to assist with the design and prototyping of their Sync Module alpha units for Kickstarter fulfillment, which served as a WiFi-enabled hub for their Blink Camera Modules. After the primary design work was completed I continued to support future design changes for the production models of their Sync and Blink Modules.</p>

                        Throughout the project I was responsible for:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Holding regular design meetings with various teams to review technical design and user needs</li>
                            <li>Iteratively designing Sync Module components for form and mechanical assembly</li>
                            <li>3D printing numerous prototypes for an iterative design process</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In late 2017 the popularity and commercialization of their cameras led to a $90 million acquisition of the company by Amazon.</p>

                        <p>During a series of observations at Boston Medical Center teams were tasked with identifying a procedure or device that caused inefficiencies or prone to failure during surgeries. Our team decided to focus on improving the efficiency of the frenotomy procedure for neonates that are tongue-tied. The current standard uses a tongue elevator, hemostat, and surgical scissors to incise the frenulum, which requires an experienced practitioner to perform due to the sensitive anatomy of a neonate. Our goal was to create a device that combines the traditional tools for this procedure, is low risk to the infants, and requires minimal training for the operator.</p>

                        Major points of the design process included the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determining user needs through numerous interviews with constituents and users</li>
                            <li>Creation of numerous initial design prototypes to determine optimal ergonomics and functions based on user feedback</li>
                            <li>Final prototypes were made using laser cutting and 3D printing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A novel frenotomy tool design was prototyped which incorporates a hemostat and a safety blade that only actuates when the hemostat clamp is completely closed. A full business plan with proposed FDA regulatory pathways, IP strategy, FMEA, and validation studies were written and presented as a part of our Master’s project. The design was also well received by several surgeons familiar with the procedure.

                    <p>CSA Medical specializes in cryoablation of internal tissue with liquid nitrogen (LN2). I was solely tasked with the ambitious project of creating a number of test fixtures that contained a 3-dimensional array of 400 temperature measurement points embedded in a tissue-mimicking material. The fixture was then used to find the amount of tissue treated during procedures by controlling for a variety of parameters. This device was used to shape many of company’s product design decisions. The work performed on this project led to an authorship on a pending patent.</p>

                    <p>I was contracted by Adapteva, a producer of high performance, credit card sized parallel processesing super-computers. Two years prior, they had successfully raised close to $1 million on Kickstarter for their low-cost consumer-grade Parallalla board. While this was primarily marketed as a research tool and sold as a bare circuit board, the CEO, Andreas Olofsson, wanted to create a more consumer-frieldly product by packaging the board with an enclosure. Additionally, due to the small size and high performance of the computer, the board would easily overheat when run at full computing power for extended periods of time. I was tasked with designing and coordinating the production of a custom-made enclosure with efficient heat-dissipation properties, while keeping costs to a minimum.
                    </p>
                    <p>Several designs were proposed, tested, and prototyped. The final design consisted of a clear-anodized aluminum plate that sit flush on the heat-generating portion of the computer with thermal paste. The improved heat-dissipation properties were verified with CPU temperature sensors and thermal imaging while running stress-tests on the computer.</p>
                    <p>Once the final design was created I contacted numerous factories that specialized in custom machining and extruded aluminum enclosures. An initial order of 5,000 units was purchased and were subsequently sold on Amazon.</p>

                    <p>Partnered with two friends, I was charged with designing and prototyping a bike mountable phone case with a built-in light reflector to amplify a phone’s flash LED. The goal of this project was to create a phone case that could replace standard bike lights. </p>
                    <p>Throughout the design process I was responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determining optimal reflector shape</li>
                        <li>Designing cases for multiple phone models</li>
                        <li>Creating a design focused on low-cost injection modling tooling</li>
                        <li>3D printing prototypes to test for fit and durability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Several design iterations were completed until we had a design that performed well in field tests. Higher quality 3D prints were made and I obtained several quotes from machine shops for the costs of tooling and injection molding runs. A Kickstarter campaign was launched to try to raise enough funds for manufacturing. Although the design was well-received it did not make the funding goal in time, which we determined was due to the product being advertised as a flashlight rather than a phone mount. Despite this, this was a good experience for project management and marketing, and it served to strengthen my product design skills.</p>
